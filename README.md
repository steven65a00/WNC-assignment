# Modelselecting.py
I do the data preprocessing and model analysis in Modelselecting.py. More detail please see the Writeup for assignment.pdf.

# predict_testing.py
I do the prediction on testing data with the best model selected by the result from Modelselecting.py in predict_testing.py.
I selected the random forest classifier as prediction model, and the predicted result is:

['B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'E', 'D', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'E', 'E', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B'] 

for the given 20 testing data.
